# The "SMART" Project 
â€“ Strategic Minimization of Airfare and Risk of Travel delays

## Team Contributions
This project is developed by:

Rajani, Mike and Mandeep

## Overview

This project analyzes flight data using the Amadeus, Meteomatics and BTS APIs to determine the percentage of flights that leave on time, seasonal variations in flight performance, and the impact of external factors such as weather and school holidays. The project also identifies popular travel destinations for locals and the cheapest flights available for top destinations.

## Features

- Analyze on-time performance of flights.
- Assess variations in flight performance by month.
- Examine the impact of school holidays (December-January, Easter, Winter break) on delays.
- Investigate the relationship between weather conditions and flight delays.
- Identify popular destinations for local travelers.
- Determine the cheapest flights for the month of December 2024.
- Find the busiest month of the year.

## Data Collection
The project uses the Amadeus, Meteomatics, BTS APIs to fetch flight data. The data is collected for various months throughout the year to analyze on-time performance and travel trends.

## Analysis
- On-Time Performance: The percentage of flights that leave on time is calculated and displayed.
- Seasonal Variations: The analysis identifies which months have the best on-time performance.
- Impact of Holidays: The project examines delays during significant holiday periods.
- Weather Influence: A weather API can be integrated to analyze its impact on flight delays.
- Local Travel Trends: The project analyzes popular destinations and flight costs for locals.

## Key Recommendations based on Data

- Flights in the USA appear most efficient in Autumn, away from holidays.
- LAX appears to experience more delays than the other airports reviewed.
- Travelling like a local means travelling domestic!
- Weather causes the most delays and cancellations in Spring and Summer in the USA.
- Avoid travelling in July and May as weather patterns are unpredictable.
- January and March are the busiest travel months, avoid if you don't like the crowds.
- Flghts are cheapest at the start of December (Fiji Airways was cheapest! (At least if you're from Sydney))
